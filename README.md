# City Builder
A game/simulation of building a city from scratch or almost from scratch. Work in progress.

## Version
Currently using `Unity 2020.3.7f1`.

## Current state
Currently the main feature is a terrain generator using [Perlin noise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perlin_noise) to generate a somewhat realisitic terrain based on a 2D vector offset. All generator parameters can easily be changed in the Unity editor.
